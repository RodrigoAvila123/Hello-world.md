# Installing a firewall on Linux

I went ahead and found a firewall for Linux so after getting my updates in I installed the firewall with this command.

After installing I was able to run it and check on the status of the firewall, it was running.

# SSH server 

I downloaded SSH with the commands Tero gave us from there I had an identity crisis and asked my computer who I was, and I was indeed me still (sad)

From there I could not connect to Tero@localhost since I didnâ€™t have a password for it, however with the create user command I made a local user Matti, from there I gave Matti a strong password and connected.

To check that it worked I became Matti for a second.
