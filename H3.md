# X.- threat modelling manifesto 
threat modelling is a tool that helps everyone be more secure, doing test and seeing how far your data, system, program can go before a break in is crucial it is based on knowing what your doing and the risks attached to it , as well your actions and what you could do better 
the best case of threat modelling is the early detection of flaws to make more secure systems, it gives value to your work and in turn it gives yourself and your company value and it's a team effort that is based on teamwork and communication, you should avoid thinking singularly, instead have multiple opinions and helpful tools for collaborative work there is no perfect solution just multiple approaches 
# worlds smallest threat modelling course
threat modelling is to make sure your can deal with problems before its expensive, its making sure the groundwork is secure before you build a house of cards
the basic idea of threat modelling is based on this simple question if you’re doing this then you’re threat modelling 
•	what are we working on
•	what can go wrong 
•	what are we going to do about it 
•	did we do a good job 
its based on collaboration and making sure you get your ideas across to your workmates, people can engage with this and give their own ideas opinions and views all this helps the questions of what are we working on, and the more clear ideas become it helps answer the next question of what can go wrong

When looking at what can go wrong its good to have structure so different people working on this procedure can still have consistent results documented and a good structure to follow is the STRIDE model, this are common problems that happen in all systems and this helps us look at a bigger scope of problems and making sure that every step is secured

For what are we going to do about it the main thing is to have the constant of tracking your work the threats found in the what could go wrong part now need to have an answer or solution and this is where risk management comes into play, it helps quantify the importance to make sure if the system can be published with the bug that can be fixed in a later sprint or if it’s something that cant be deployed and it has to be fixed asap 
So did we do a good job, with what we have done is this something you recommend, was this effort worth it, did you learn and work trough the process that this had a significant impact in production, the answer if the method is applied correctly should be yes 
# OWASP Threat modelling cheat sheet 
For the useful terminology there are keywords like threat agent, impact of damage, likelihood of an attack, controls, preventions and mitigations, all this are good useful tools when doing threat modelling
to not go over the same data ill try to summary key points that I haven’t talked about before in my summaries 
when making a data flow chart this helps with looking at how everything moves, this helps have visualization of where entry and weak points are it also helps seeing data in transit and stationary, you have a clear idea of valuable targets that are a good entry point for a threat agent and who those threat agents might be 
how would you do it? Doing an attack vector or tree could help mitigate attacks as well as use and abuse cases, this helps with identifying logical threats this information is crucial for identifying how likely and attack would be and the impact it would have, the next Stuxnet would kill your system but there is a negligible chance that you could be targeted with an attack like that (as a regular person conducting regular business) but injections even though less damaging have a way higher chance of occurring 
this is where risk management with DREAD comes handy 
•	Damage - how bad would an attack be?
•	Reproducibility - how easy it is to reproduce the attack?
•	Exploitability - how much work is it to launch the attack?
•	Affected users - how many people will be impacted?
•	Discoverability - how easy it is to discover the threat?
Risk Value = (Damage + Affected users) x (Reproducibility + Exploitability + Discoverability).

With this formula you have a clear idea or what a threat value is, that’s where PASTA “Attack Simulation & Threat Analysis” comes in, this is a way you can decide where to deploy counter measures and give them the proper resources they need 

# A.	Security hygiene 
With security there are always steps we can all take, from baby steps to paranoid giant steps, with this some of the recommendations would be 
Basic 
•	Use strong passwords that are unique to every service  
•	Update your software whenever possible 
•	Backup your data 
•	Have a firewall or antivirus 
•	Encrypt your hard drive 
•	Double check whenever possible if your security services are open source and secure themselves 
# B.-  (1) my company and my security 
For my company its an integrated company that you can put your income, tax bracket, and your outcomes, it tracks your financial information and with this you can make better financial decisions on what expenses to cut and how to save money, it has no actual control over your money in the entry tier so just costumer data but in the paid monthly model of the service you can get an investment portfolio set by us and a set amount of money you want to give can be invested monthly, this can come easily from unnecessary expenses that you have and can identify with our income tracking software 
Since our service cannot access your financial information from your bank trough an API the service rellies on the user to input the outcomes by themselves, that’s not ideal but with proof of concept this could easily be sold to a bank and with their data it could be a better integrated system that could help people get out of debt or same more money

# b.- (2) what could go wrong 
it would be quite easy to know our service providers since that information needs to be public so the transfer of data would be encrypted but if one of those services has had an attack and is compromised so are we, getting access to our services there could be multiple entry points, with a website and app there are many queries and requests from our services so there could be a vulnerability our main concern would be to have our servers and data transfer to third parties be the most secure, the actual website and app have to also be secure so there is no injected code that can mislead users to give data that isn’t needed and it’s just a phishing attempt from a threat actor 
the highest value we have is the banking transactions if we have a paid model, this would have to be handled encrypted trough a third party with banking authentication, where our biggest effort is if we have a successful paid model would be in securing that data, our name and value would be how secure we are, having data breaches or losing clients information would be a big loose in our own value 
even though it would be low probability there would be a massive attack the monetary loss would be something almost impossible to come back from so there should be a high level of resources into stress testing and attack simulations to make sure the obvious attacks couldn’t work, security would be symbiotic between us and our cloud service providers 
dealing with financial personal information we would be a target for threat actors looking for monetary gain as well as people who want semi detailed personal financial information from a specific individual
# b.- (3) what are we going to do about it 
getting in contact with our service providers and stage tests into security, have staff do frequent tests and attacks before the service is live, seeing possible backdoors, injection paths and vulnerabilities 
we would hire third party companies to do security audits and see if we have a comprehensive security in place, with their help if there are vulnerabilities we can work on them after assessing how much importance it has to the bottom line of making sure our costumers are secured as well as the company making money
limit our entry points and make sure we have segmented permissions in the office and people have as little permissions as they need to do their work, we are transferring risk to bigger could services that have billion dollar security ideally, and we are mitigating risk by making sure we do as much as we can to patch our vulnerabilities 
some risks have to be accepted but since we are working in the financial sector and it will never be fully secure but as much as we can mitigate 
# b.- (4) did we do a good enough job 
for our part we are looking for the best service providers and mating sure we are up to date and making continuous tests and having third party audits and for all features that would be introduced in sprints a crucial part would be having test environments before release to tests the updated system for vulnerabilities 
so overall this could be a semi comprehensive way to defend our system with a combination of services, our own work and audits.
