# Security misconfiguration 

A security misconfiguration is when your application  or system is improperly managed and open vulnerabilities with what permissions it gives allowing for unauthorized access this is usually from human errors in manual configurations of systems, failing to change default settings lack of updates, excessive permissions mismanaging API’s.
This can lead to many things that are related to lack of security like data breaches, downtime in your services unauthorized access , malware attacks and financial losses .
The best ways to defend against this would be to make sure you can launch a new secure environment fast, segmenting your different departments and with secure and different credentials, making sure your platform is minimal and whatever doesn’t need to be there shouldn’t be there. Keeping up with updates and patches and automated verification for security processes 

# Vulnerable and Outdated Components

This is when a collection has outdates software or hardware with known security flaws that could easily be exploited.
To prevent you need to know what you have and use, keeping up to date with patches and releases, knowing what hardware client and server-side is being used and knowing when a certain software/hardware has been exploited by malicious threats, make sure you get components over secure sources.

# Injection

The most common injection is the SQL injection there are many more like command injection, XSS and code injection it commonly occurs when there is poor input validation and malicious third parties can exploit this to enter a system.
The best ways to prevent an injection would be to use a safe API that would avoid entirely interpreting the data that way there is a smaller probability of malicious code entry points  and limiting SQL controls with querries 

# webGOAT

well it was very difficult to get the setup running, I wasn’t familiar with linux tools but after some trial an error I managed to get all downloads going and from the terminal activate my firewall and start the hacking, 
developer tools are quite useful so I wouldn’t say I know their full potential but I’m familiar with them, asking for a specific JS request was quite interesting since from the console I’m working with the code and it gives clear answers, also HTTP requests can be seen from within the console window, both of this would be helpful to find entry points and vulnerabilities to programs or services

# SQLzoo 

more than an SQL injection this just felt like casual queries I haven’t personally worked with SQL but it with some coding experience this was just push and retrieval methods, good to practice parameters of retrieval

# SQL injection 

In this exercise I remembered a bit of how it was shown in class, after some research the line “'+OR+1=1--” was what the solution was it ends the query prematurely adds the condition OR and then make it true with 1=1 and then make the rest of the query a comment inside SQL to kill the rest of the query
