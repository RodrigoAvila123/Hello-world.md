Cyphers are the way to transmit messages without unintended people being able to read the information, this is based on mathematical formulas that encrypt the plaintext and then decrypt it with a cryptographic algorithm,
This follows the principles of Confidentiality, integrity and availability, the message when transmitted has to be confidential and the sender and reciter have to de easily identifiable to each other, there are symmetrical algorithms and asymmetrical algorithms, in a symmetrical you have key and the sender and receiver have to agree on a decryption key beforehand that way they can get access to the plain text, with an asymmetrical you have 2 keys a public key and a private key, with a  public key anyone can encrypt a message but only one person can decrypt it with the corresponding private key to the public key.
Cryptanalysis is the study of trying to break these systems, there are 4 types of attacks 
•	Ciphertext-only attack
•	Known-plaintext attack
•	Chosen-plaintext attack
•	Adaptive-chosen-plaintext attack
This focus on finding the key or keys that are used for encryption, they go about in different ways, and it depends on what parameters your attack follows and what resources you have for your attack, if you have the encrypted text plus the plain text and from there you cross reference and try to gain the key then you are doing a known-plaintext attack.
The security of algorithms is based on factors that have to do with the cost and time of the information if the price of the information is lower than the price of the attack its most likely safer and if the information in the message is of importance and the time to break the system is longer than the relevance of the message then it’s safer as well.

frequency distribution for the Spanish language, while looking at this results that I pulled from the internet I can see the there are similarities as in the English frequencies but at the same time it different and interesting, the vowel distribution is the same following E, A, O, I, but in Spanish vowels are used to a much bigger degree than in English, and for the consonants, there are less similarities with the letter N being the only similarity in consonant distribution.
Spanish 	English 
•	E - 13.69%	•	E - 11.16%
•	A - 11.87%	•	T - 9.95%
•	O - 8.44%	•	A - 8.17%
•	I - 7.02%	•	O - 7.51%
•	S - 7.00%	•	I - 7.12%
•	N - 6.25%	•	N - 6.80%

the password manager I chose was DashLane since I was watching a YouTube video and there was an ad for it, so I investigated the company,
•	It protects against attacks by outsourcing data storage to the users device, the application is where the hashes are stored, not in the DashLane servers so if they are compromised the users data cannot be accessed 
•	All information is encrypted with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit encryption, and the local data is encrypted with Argon2d 
•	There is some data stored in the DashLane servers like user info and device key this data in encrypted and moved as encrypted data, for the passwords they are encrypted and can only be access if the user has the master password and that’s not stored by DashLane 
•	It’s protected by being offloaded to a local users device and can’t be accessed trough a server, and the hashes stored in the users device can only e decrypted with the master password

so to break this message I started by looking into easily recognizable words “KWU'YI” was very likely to be the word “you’re” so I had some letter to begin with, then the website was the second part that I looked at  “DHHP://HIYWLMYCTAIA.OWG” so from here I can see “http” followed by “.com” from there I tried to see what the websites name could be so with the letters I had available already I started decrypting the websites name and I could piece together “teroXXrXXXeX” so I assumed the text would be terokarvinen since there is a repeating letter in the encryption “AIA” that would fit “NEN” so with now 16 letters supposedly cracked I got to work manually

That’s it you’re now officially a codebreaker! As you see, simple substitution ciphers can be broken with frequency analysis, see you at http://terokarvinen.com

for my data encryption I went with the windows encryption, this way your files can be encrypted with command lines written 
![image](https://github.com/RodrigoAvila123/Hello-world.md/assets/122974038/f3506dca-8079-4aad-8796-f817a4d632bf)
Now this was unsuccessful since I have windows home, I thought I would upgrade to windows 11 pro but its 145 euros so at the moment ill just explain what should happen.
With the command cipher /e after a directory path is given the windows EFS safely encrypts the files
