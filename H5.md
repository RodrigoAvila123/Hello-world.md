# X1.- One-way functions 
One-way functions are half real, in the way that we use them in cryptography but a real one way function doesn’t exist, this functions are in the way that you can hash a password in milliseconds but reversing it will take millions of years, ergo one way, since reversing it is not technically impossible but when you see the time vs reward analysis it’s not on the side of the attacker, there is however a subset of this function, a trapdoor one way function, this means that with certain hidden information it is quite easy to go back to the original plaintext, taking this factor into account then a hash or an encrypted message can be easily decrypted or broken if you know what’s the missing part of the formula.
# X2.- Phishing trough email
Phishing trough email is when you give a link to a malicious website trough deceptive means, with this you could inject code and move laterally in your targets system, it’s still quite common for people to click malicious links if it is about people expecting mail or being curious about a statement, it could very well happen today, one of the way to combat this would be sender policy framework (SPF) and DKIM this allow the receiver to validate that the email is coming from a legit source and it has encrypted headers that help identify how was this email sent and by whom, however if you set a fake domain and set this same tool on your email that goes with malicious code or with a malicious website then your mail will not get stopped by automated detection since you would have legit credentials that then don’t get flagged by spam filters 
# A.- install hashcat
I followed the teachers guide on how to install hashcat and in the guide there is a target hash, I followed the instruction on getting updates and downloading hashcat, from there I downloaded RockYou.txt and got to cracking, I identified the hash method and then broke the password, as shows in class it’s summer but it was nice doing it by myself

# B.- cracking another hash 

I got the new hash we need to crack, started by analysing the method.

Then I ran the hash using rockyou.txt again

And it cracked it

And the password is February

# C.- gone phishing 
So for my phish I will set up a domain let’s say jobseekers.com try to make it generic but not overly special, set up an email server and have domain emails, make the server legitimate with secure permissions and the domain a clean modern silicon valley (blue and white) look, in email leaks I would start getting after people and sending emails with job offers, the domain has fake job offers in different fields, could be AI generated or could be manual work, once you get the email if curiosity gets the better of you, you could click the link, if you need a job, you could click the link, however if you’re cautious there would be advertisements made that this is a legit website and service, even with a page with testimonials about how we helped people get jobs 
Once you click the link if you did you get to a registration page, in there you will be asked to make an account, at this point the account will be made and we can get your information and more than likely it the same password as other services, this website will run malicious code in your machine and try to get a backdoor to your device, in the website its all rainbows and roses still you can see the fake jobs that link to real companies, you can apply for this fake jobs inside our service and you will get an email of confirmation that the company will be in contact with you in the future to discuss the application further
