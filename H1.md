##Stuxnet attack 
With combat moving away from the usual warfare a new window of opportunity is opening, with tensions rising in Iran with the building of uranium enrichment plants there are plenty of nations that would like to see this unstable nation fail at their task, in the end in collaboration between several branches of government the Americans and Israelis started working together on a zero-day exploit.
The code is meant to work in a way where it self-replicates in a worm style and just activates when certain conditions are met, that was the last iteration but it had several steps to get there, the code started as a “simple” code that would disrupt pressure valves and make the centrifuges spin at a fast rate until destabilized and then continue normal operations, so as to appear to be a mechanical failure.
The attack was considered the first cyberweapon, however it wasn’t just one attack it was a culmination of several different attacks ending in the famous malware we now know, due to the nature of the facility being air-gapped the method of injection wouldn’t be as straight forward, with 3 successful injections there were several methods of injection.
The first “known” injection is believed to be a supply chain injection where power supplies where manually injected with malware to give mechanical failures to the centrifuges.
The second injection was achieved by getting the engineers and workers from the plant to un-knowingly inject the virus, this was achieved by giving away USB sticks with Stuxnet in conferences where this people were known to attend, once connected into the network of the processing plant the code could move inside and start its work.
The third injection was the most dangerous, this time after having altered the code many times the Israelis were concerned that progress wasn’t moving fast enough so they opted to add a “worm” to the code, meaning it self-replicates from every connection, then the code would run a simple calculation of what parameters it had, what computer, region, software installed, and if it had everything it would get to work, disabling the monitoring system and replicating what would be considered safe conditions as to not arouse suspicions, then make the extraction of enriched uranium less efficient and in the process disrupt the oscillations of the centrifuges to eventually break them.
This was the most sophisticated attack of its time with 4 zero-day exploits across different software, but could the Iranians have avoided it? While their system was air-gapped the workers and engineers made several mistakes of taking outside hardware and plug it into the system a rookie mistake when dealing with such secure environments, as well as having one failsafe for monitoring and not coaming trough data and secured data to see what is lurking on their files as well as not rigorously testing the hardware they get from suppliers.
What could have been done better with Stuxnet was not adding the worm, this was a groundbreaking software and when it was discovered all experts where impressed by how many vulnerabilities it exploited, the last minute decision of adding a self-replication was their downfall otherwise it would have likely never been discovered and maybe it could have been used again in the future.

##Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defence Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains 
With the rise of networks there is a rise in cyber-attacks, this attacks are for information or monetary gain, with out heavily digitalized world it’s a game of cat and mouse of who can outdo who, attacks generate anti-malware software that then generate more sophisticated attacks like APT and “advanced persistent threat” where the code tries to get as much data in a more advanced way where it can self-mask, circumvent anti-malware software and more efficiently get data from their target 
Defending against an APT is not a simple task, when following the kill chain method there are several steps where you would need to detect the malware and act on it unless having direct access to communication from the actors behind an attack it would most likely be easiest to detect in the delivery method, with ways to detect software that has been installed into a network and making sure exploits are being monitored and patched so they can’t be exploited.
There is new ways to defend with risk analysis with intelligence such as knowing what the actors behind and APT want with this its easier to know what resources the attackers have with this knowledge defenders then can make a risk analysis of where and how far they can get and strengthen defences around what would be a realistic target and killing the kill chain before it materializes in their network.
Understanding failure is necessary when defending a network, once a APT has been detected a reverse-engineering should take place to see what steps have been completed successfully and understand what happened to get to this place, patching vulnerabilities in software or with supply chains, human error comes from analysing those mistakes and making sure it cant happen again.
